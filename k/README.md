I have solved more than 50 problems on the HackerRank platform to practice and improve my skills in various topics. I
have gained proficiency in writing code and manipulating data. Throughout this journey, I have learned a lot in
different areas, including Basic Select, Advanced Select, Aggregation, Basic Join, Advanced Join, and Alternative
Queries and this some exercises:
select 

    SELECT DISTINCT city
    FROM STATION
    WHERE city REGEXP '^[aeiou]';
    -- Retrieve distinct cities from the STATION table that start with a vowels

ex1

    SELECT DISTINCT city
    FROM STATION
    WHERE city REGEXP '^[aeiou]' and city regexp '[aeiou]$';
    -- This query retrieves distinct cities from the "STATION" table that both start with a vowel (^[aeiou]) and
    -- end with a vowel ([aeiou]$). The AND operator is used to combine the two regular expression conditions.
    
ex2:

    -- in the start and the end of ant city name
    SELECT DISTINCT city
    FROM STATION
    WHERE NOT city REGEXP '^[aeiou]' and NOT city regexp '[aeiou]$';

ex3:

    -- This query will retrieve the names of students who have marks greater than 75 and then sort them based
    -- on the last three characters of their names. If there are ties in the last three characters, the sorting
    -- will be done based on the "id" column.
    SELECT NAME
    FROM students
    WHERE MARKS > 75
    ORDER BY (RIGHT(NAME, 3)), id;

Aggregation
ex1

    --In this query, MAX(LAT_N) retrieves the maximum latitude value, MIN(LAT_N) retrieves the minimum latitude value,
    -- MIN(LONG_W) retrieves the minimum longitude value, and MAX(LONG_W) retrieves the maximum longitude value from the "STATION" table.
    --The ABS function is used to get the absolute value of the differences between these values. Finally, the sum
    --of the absolute differences is calculated and returned as the result.
    SELECT ABS (MAX(LAT_N) - MIN(LAT_N)) +  ABS (MIN(LONG_W) - MAX(LONG_W))
    FROM STATION;

ex2

    -- Retrieve the sum of the population from the CITY table
    SELECT SUM(POPULATION)
    FROM CITY
    -- Filter the rows based on the value in the DISTRICT column, specifically 'California'
    WHERE DISTRICT = 'California';

ex3

    -- Retrieve the average population from the CITY table
    SELECT AVG(POPULATION)
    FROM CITY
    -- Filter the rows based on the value in the DISTRICT column, specifically 'California'
    WHERE DISTRICT = 'California';

ex4


    -- Retrieve the sum of the population from the CITY table
    SELECT SUM(POPULATION)
    FROM CITY
    -- Filter the rows based on the value in the COUNTRYCODE column, specifically 'JPN'
    WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'JPN';
ex5


    -- Retrieve the rounded average salary and subtract the rounded average salary without zeros
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(SALARY)) - ROUND(AVG(REPLACE(SALARY, 0, "")))
    FROM EMPLOYEES;

ex6

    -- Calculate earnings and count based on salary and months, then retrieve the highest result
    SELECT (salary * months) as earnings, COUNT(*)
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY earnings
    ORDER BY earnings DESC
    LIMIT 1;


    -- Retrieve the rounded maximum latitude (LAT_N) that is less than 137.2345
    SELECT ROUND(MAX(LAT_N), 4)
    FROM STATION
    WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345;


 variables 


    -- Calculate the middle row number by dividing the total row count by 2 and rounding down
    SET @row_n = (SELECT CAST(FLOOR(COUNT(*)/2) AS SIGNED) FROM STATION);
    
    -- Prepare a statement to select the latitude value rounded to 4 decimal places from the station table
    -- The statement orders the rows by latitude and retrieves only 1 row, starting from the middle row determined by @row_n
    PREPARE STMT FROM 'SELECT ROUND(LAT_N,4) FROM STATION ORDER BY LAT_N LIMIT 1 OFFSET ?';
    
    -- Execute the prepared statement using the middle row number (@row_n) as the offset parameter
    EXECUTE STMT USING @row_n;



Joining
    
    -- Select the continent from the COUNTRY table and calculate the rounded-down average population of cities
    -- Join the COUNTRY and CITY tables based on the CountryCode column
    -- Group the result by continent
    SELECT COUNTRY.Continent, FLOOR(AVG(CITY.Population))
    FROM COUNTRY
    INNER JOIN CITY ON CITY.CountryCode = COUNTRY.Code
    GROUP BY COUNTRY.Continent;
ex
        
    -- Select the sum of the population from the CITY table
    -- Join the CITY and COUNTRY tables based on the CountryCode column
    -- Filter the result to include only rows where the continent is 'ASIA'
    SELECT SUM(CITY.POPULATION)
    FROM CITY
    INNER JOIN COUNTRY ON CITY.CountryCode = COUNTRY.Code
    WHERE COUNTRY.CONTINENT = 'ASIA';


    -- Select the name if the grade is greater than or equal to 8, otherwise select NULL
    -- Also select the grade and marks columns
    -- Retrieve data from the STUDENTS and GRADES tables
    -- Filter the results to include only rows where the marks are within the specified range
    -- Sort the results in descending order by grade and then by name
    SELECT IF(GRADE < 8, NULL, NAME), GRADE, MARKS
    FROM STUDENTS
    JOIN GRADES
    WHERE MARKS BETWEEN MIN_MARK AND MAX_MARK
    ORDER BY GRADE DESC, NAME;

Ex1:

        -- Select the name of cities from the CITY table
        -- Join the CITY and COUNTRY tables based on the CountryCode column
        -- Filter the result to include only rows where the continent is 'AFRICA'
        SELECT CITY.NAME
        FROM CITY
        INNER JOIN COUNTRY ON CITY.CountryCode = COUNTRY.Code
        WHERE COUNTRY.CONTINENT = 'AFRICA';

 Ex2:

        -- Select the ID, age, coins needed, and power from the WANDS and WANDS_PROPERTY tables
        -- Join the WANDS and WANDS_PROPERTY tables based on the CODE column
        -- Filter the result to include only rows where the wand is not evil and the coins needed is the minimum value for the corresponding power and age combination
        -- Sort the result in descending order by power and then by age
            SELECT W.ID, P.AGE, W.COINS_NEEDED, W.POWER
            FROM WANDS AS W
            JOIN WANDS_PROPERTY AS P
            ON (W.CODE = P.CODE)
            WHERE P.IS_EVIL = 0 AND W.COINS_NEEDED = (SELECT MIN(COINS_NEEDED)
            FROM WANDS AS X
            JOIN WANDS_PROPERTY AS Y
            ON (X.CODE = Y.CODE)
            WHERE X.POWER = W.POWER AND Y.AGE = P.AGE)
            ORDER BY W.POWER DESC, P.AGE DESC;
